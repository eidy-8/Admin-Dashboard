This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, focusing on enhancing knowledge of CSS Grid to create an admin dashboard. The admin dashboard includes features such as a navigation bar, user profile section, project cards, announcements, and a trending section.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to implement a responsive and visually appealing admin dashboard using CSS Grid. The dashboard includes various components such as user profiles, project cards, announcements, and a trending section.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **HTML:** The main HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the dashboard, including header, navigation, main content, and sidebar sections.
